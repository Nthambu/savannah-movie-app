## bonus: Design Thinking and Planning

Before writing any code, the application's structure and user flow were planned out. A low-fidelity wireframe was generated using the AI-powered design tool Uizard to visualize the component hierarchy and screen layouts. This design-first approach ensured a clear and logical development process.
